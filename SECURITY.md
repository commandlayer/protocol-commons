# Security Policy — Protocol-Commons

Protocol-Commons defines **the language** agents use.  
If schemas break, automation breaks — so security and simplicity matter.

We maintain this layer like infrastructure: steady and reliable.

## What to Report

- Schema bugs or constraint gaps  
- `$id` mismatch or non-resolvable URLs  
- CID or checksum inconsistencies  
- Anything creating ambiguity in verb meaning

Private reporting helps keep agents safe while fixes ship.

## Response Targets

- **72 hours** — acknowledgment  
- **10 business days** — mitigation plan  

Breaking issues are prioritized.

---

## Integrity Rules

- Versioned directories are **immutable** once published  
- All schemas pinned to IPFS + checksummed  
- Strict, reproducible CI validation  
- Any change requires **a new version** — never hot patches

These guarantees keep Commons safe to depend on long-term.

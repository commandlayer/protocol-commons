    "steps": [
      "First, it defines a minimal set of verbs that most agents need.",
      "Second, each verb has strict request and receipt schemas using JSON Schema 2020-12.",
      "Third, the schemas are aligned with x402 and ERC-8004 so agents can discover and invoke them over standard rails.",
      "Finally, the repo is MIT-licensed and intended to remain stable as a canonical contract layer."
